TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
I learnt about strings, variables, functions. It was pretty cool. 

My mind was blown with indexing. 

I learnt that you can't add strings to integers. You can make an integer into a string with str(). This is called casting

I learnt how to debug, which will help me when the code we do gets more complicated. 

I learnt that using for x in some_words will print the values in some_words, but print(some_words) will print some_words formatted as a list

Len gives you the number of items in a list

I really struggled with exercise 3 and needed the videos on the course page to assist. The loops are hard for me to wrap my head around.
